In modern urban environments, the surge in vehicle usage has made efficient parking management a pressing necessity. This mini project proposes a smart web-based parking management system that automates the entire parking process from vehicle entry to exit. When a vehicle arrives at the parking facility, a camera captures and recognizes its number plate and determines the vehicle type. The system then logs the entry time, checks slot availability in real time, and either allocates a slot automatically or denies entry if full. This reduces manual dependency and optimizes space usage. All records are securely stored in a database, ensuring traceability and structured monitoring of parking activity.

At the time of exit, the system again detects the vehicle through number plate recognition, records the exit time, and calculates the parking fee based on duration and vehicle type, with a minimum charge of â‚¹10 applied to all vehicles regardless of time spent. A dynamic QR code is generated for UPI-based payment, accessible to all users, while registered users with sufficient wallet balance can opt for wallet payment. Upon successful payment, a digital bill is generated and the payment status is updated in the system. A staff member stationed at the monitor verifies this status and ensures that no vehicle exits without payment. This system blends automation, real-time processing, and flexible digital payments to deliver a seamless and smart parking experience.
